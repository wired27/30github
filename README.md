## Day 1: Even or Odd Checker in Go  

A simple program that checks whether a number is even or odd.  

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var num int
    fmt.Print("Enter a number: ")
    fmt.Scan(&num)

    if num%2 == 0 {
        fmt.Println(num, "is an even number.")
    } else {
        fmt.Println(num, "is an odd number.")
    }
}
```
